### Patch Changes

- [#1353](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1353) [`f834c81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f834c814db16a6b7cba51cebef4be02b9364a088) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Align `AIChatAgent` generics and types with `@cloudflare/think`, plus a reference example for multi-session chat built on the sub-agent routing primitive.

  - **New `Props` generic**: `AIChatAgent<Env, State, Props>` extending `Agent<Env, State, Props>`. Subclasses now get properly typed `this.ctx.props`.
  - **Shared lifecycle types**: `ChatResponseResult`, `ChatRecoveryContext`, `ChatRecoveryOptions`, `SaveMessagesResult`, and `MessageConcurrency` now live in `agents/chat` and are re-exported by both `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think`. No behavior change; one place to edit when shapes evolve.
  - **`ChatMessage` stays the public message type**: the package continues to export `ChatMessage`, and the public API/docs keep using that name.
  - **`messages` stays a public field**: `messages: ChatMessage[]`.

  The full stance (AIChatAgent is first-class, production-ready, and continuing to get features; shared infrastructure should land in `agents/chat` where both classes benefit) is captured in [`design/rfc-ai-chat-maintenance.md`](../design/rfc-ai-chat-maintenance.md).

  A new example, `examples/multi-ai-chat`, demonstrates the multi-session pattern end-to-end on top of the sub-agent routing primitive: an `Inbox` Agent owns the chat list + shared memory; each chat is an `AIChatAgent` facet (`this.subAgent(Chat, id)`). The client addresses the active chat via `useAgent({ sub: [{ agent: "Chat", name: chatId }] })` — no separate DO binding, no custom routing on the server. `Inbox.onBeforeSubAgent` gates with `hasSubAgent` as a strict registry, and `Chat` reaches its parent via `this.parentAgent(Inbox)`.

- [#1355](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1355) [`df2023f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/df2023fbd5ddf7d4acc90ba56d46b38867a57a3b) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - External addressability for sub-agents.

  Clients can now reach a facet (a child DO created by `Agent#subAgent()`) directly via a nested URL:

      /agents/{parent-class}/{parent-name}/sub/{child-class}/{child-name}[/...]

  New public APIs (all `@experimental`):

  - `routeSubAgentRequest(req, parent, options?)` — sub-agent analog of `routeAgentRequest`. For custom-routing setups where the outer URL doesn't match the default `/agents/...` shape.
  - `getSubAgentByName(parent, Cls, name)` — sub-agent analog of `getAgentByName`. Returns a typed Proxy that round-trips typed RPC calls through the parent. RPC-only (no `.fetch()`); use `routeSubAgentRequest` for external HTTP/WS.
  - `parseSubAgentPath(url, options?)` — public URL parser used internally by the routers.
  - `SUB_PREFIX` — the `"sub"` separator constant (not configurable; exposed for symbolic URL building).

  New public on `Agent`:

  - `onBeforeSubAgent(req, { className, name })` — overridable middleware hook, mirrors `onBeforeConnect` / `onBeforeRequest`. Returns `Request | Response | void` for short-circuit responses, request mutation, or passthrough. Default: void.
  - `parentPath` / `selfPath` — root-first `{ className, name }` ancestor chains, populated at facet init time. Inductive across recursive nesting.
  - `hasSubAgent(ClsOrName, name)` / `listSubAgents(ClsOrName?)` — parent-side introspection backed by an auto-maintained SQLite registry written by `subAgent()` / `deleteSubAgent()`. Both accept either the class constructor or a CamelCase class name string.

  New public on `useAgent` (React):

  - `sub?: Array<{ agent, name }>` — flat root-first chain addressing a descendant facet. The hook's `.agent` / `.name` report the leaf identity; `.path` exposes the full chain.

  Breaking changes: none. `routeAgentRequest` behavior is unchanged when URLs don't contain `/sub/`. `onBeforeSubAgent` defaults to permissive (forward unchanged). `useAgent` without `sub` is unchanged. `subAgent()` / `deleteSubAgent()` gain registry side effects but preserve return types and failure modes. The `_cf_initAsFacet` signature gained an optional `parentPath` parameter. `deleteSubAgent()` is now idempotent — calling it for a never-spawned or already-deleted child no longer throws. Sub-agent class names equal to `"Sub"` are rejected (the `/sub/` URL separator is reserved).

  See `design/rfc-sub-agent-routing.md` for the full rationale, design decisions, and edge cases. The spike at `packages/agents/src/tests/spike-sub-agent-routing.test.ts` documents the three candidate approaches considered for cross-DO stub passthrough and why the per-call bridge won.

- [#1346](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1346) [`a78bb2a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a78bb2a8903bce060b4a6c29796e5590315fe210) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Remove unused `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` from the `agents` package.

  - `dependencies`: drop `json-schema`, `json-schema-to-typescript`, and `picomatch`. None are imported by the package; `picomatch` was already pulled in transitively via `@rolldown/plugin-babel`.
  - `devDependencies`: drop `@ai-sdk/openai` (only referenced in a commented-out line) and `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` (not referenced anywhere).
  - `peerDependencies` / `peerDependenciesMeta`: drop `@ai-sdk/react` and `viem`. `@ai-sdk/react` is already a peer of `@cloudflare/ai-chat` (itself an optional peer here), and `viem` is a regular dependency of `@x402/evm`, so both are supplied transitively when the relevant optional features are used.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1330](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1330) [`b4d3fcf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b4d3fcfcce7363b137ad47c31d40aebcb34d9a28) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `subAgent()` cross-DO I/O errors on first use and drop the `"experimental"` compatibility flag requirement.

  ### `subAgent()` cross-DO I/O fix

  Three issues in the facet initialization path caused `"Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different Durable Object"` errors when spawning sub-agents in production:

  - `subAgent()` constructed a `Request` in the parent DO and passed it to the child via `stub.fetch()`. The `Request` carried native I/O tied to the parent isolate, which the child rejected.
  - The facet flag was set _after_ the first `onStart()` ran, so `broadcastMcpServers()` fired with `_isFacet === false` on the initial boot.
  - `_broadcastProtocol()`, the inherited `broadcast()`, and `_workflow_broadcast()` iterated the connection registry without an `_isFacet` guard, letting broadcasts reach into the parent DO's WebSocket registry from a child isolate.

  Replaces the fetch-based handshake with a new `_cf_initAsFacet(name)` RPC that runs entirely in the child isolate, sets `_isFacet` before init, and seeds partyserver's `__ps_name` key directly. Adds `_isFacet` guards to `_broadcastProtocol()` and overrides `broadcast()` to no-op on facets so downstream callers (chat-streaming paths, workflow broadcasts, user `this.broadcast(...)`) are covered. Removes the previous internal `_cf_markAsFacet()` method — `_cf_initAsFacet(name)` is the correct entry point (it sets the flag before running the first `onStart()`, which `_cf_markAsFacet` did not).

  ### `"experimental"` compatibility flag no longer required

  `ctx.facets`, `ctx.exports`, and `env.LOADER` (Worker Loader) have graduated out of the `"experimental"` compatibility flag in workerd. `agents` and `@cloudflare/think` no longer require it:

  - `subAgent()` / `abortSubAgent()` / `deleteSubAgent()` — the `@experimental` JSDoc tag and runtime error messages no longer reference the flag. The runtime guards on `ctx.facets` / `ctx.exports` stay in place and now nudge users toward updating `compatibility_date` instead.
  - `Think` — the `@experimental` JSDoc tag no longer references the flag.

  No code change is required; remove `"experimental"` from your `compatibility_flags` in `wrangler.jsonc` if it was only there for these features.

- [#1332](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1332) [`7cb8acf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7cb8acff8281a30bc17980e506ab5582f3cb1c72) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Expose `createdAt` on fiber and chat recovery contexts so apps can suppress continuations for stale, interrupted turns.

  - `FiberRecoveryContext` (from `agents`) gains `createdAt: number` — epoch milliseconds when `runFiber` started, read from the `cf_agents_runs` row that was already tracked internally.
  - `ChatRecoveryContext` (from `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and `@cloudflare/think`) gains the same `createdAt` field, threaded through from the underlying fiber.

  With this, the stale-recovery guard pattern described in [#1324](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1324) is a short override:

  ```typescript
  override async onChatRecovery(ctx: ChatRecoveryContext): Promise<ChatRecoveryOptions> {
    if (Date.now() - ctx.createdAt > 2 * 60 * 1000) return { continue: false };
    return {};
  }
  ```

  No behavior change for existing callers. See `docs/chat-agents.md` (new "Guarding against stale recoveries" section) for the full recipe, including a loop-protection pattern using `onChatResponse`.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1326](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1326) [`d5042a9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d5042a90df0f863da8ce43ebacec879668ef2423) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix(mcp): block full IPv6 link-local range `fe80::/10` in SSRF check

  `isBlockedUrl` in the MCP client claimed to block `fe80::/10` but the
  previous `startsWith("fe80")` check only matched the narrower
  `fe80::/16`, letting valid link-local addresses in the `fe81::`–`febf::`
  range slip through. Replaced with a regex that matches the full /10
  (first hextet `fe80` through `febf`), factored the IPv6 private-range
  logic into `isPrivateIPv6`, and added regression tests for the
  previously-leaking prefixes plus negative cases at the /10 boundary
  (`fe7f::`, `fec0::`).

  Reported in [#1325](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1325).

### Patch Changes

- [#1279](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1279) [`eae6a30`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/eae6a30d8b047db2afd1564eb5615a5ed5e6e2a2) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Add `sendEmail()` method to the Agent class for sending outbound email via Cloudflare Email Service. Pass your `send_email` binding explicitly as `this.sendEmail({ binding: this.env.EMAIL, ... })`. Automatically injects agent routing headers and supports optional HMAC signing for secure reply routing.

- [`dccc747`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/dccc7475279f5a46afa4edcfd3093dea45cb0df0) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Update dependencies

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1163](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1163) [`d3f757c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d3f757c264f6271cb34863daaad0e381e40e6a6f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add experimental browser CDP tools for the Agents SDK, using the live Browser Rendering protocol instead of bundling the spec and covering the local browser-binding flow with Wrangler-backed end-to-end tests.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1301](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1301) [`d501291`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d5012914fe6b4d663b31a89e9699a5a5a01db73c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `applyChunkToParts` dropping `providerMetadata` on `reasoning-end` and `reasoning-delta` chunks. For Anthropic models with extended/adaptive thinking, the thinking block signature arrives on `reasoning-end.providerMetadata.anthropic.signature`. Without persisting it, `convertToModelMessages` produces reasoning parts with no signature, causing `@ai-sdk/anthropic` to silently drop the thinking block on subsequent turns — effectively making extended thinking single-turn only. The reasoning handlers now merge `chunk.providerMetadata` onto the persisted part, matching the behavior of source and tool chunk handlers in the same file. Fixes [#1299](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/1299).

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1286](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1286) [`d76f8b9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d76f8b9608cbf4b4bbeb5f92077057ff20dbeae9) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `McpAgent.handleMcpMessage` crashing with "Attempting to read .name before it was set" when the Durable Object wakes from hibernation via native DO RPC. The method now calls `__unsafe_ensureInitialized()` to hydrate `this.name` from storage and run `onStart()` before processing messages, matching the pattern used by `_workflow_*` RPC methods and `alarm()`.

- [#1278](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1278) [`8c7caab`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/8c7caabb68361c8ce71b10e292d6dd33a9cc72dd) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Think now owns the inference loop with lifecycle hooks at every stage.

  **Breaking:** `onChatMessage()`, `assembleContext()`, and `getMaxSteps()` are removed. Use lifecycle hooks and the `maxSteps` property instead. If you need full custom inference, extend `Agent` directly.

  **New lifecycle hooks:** `beforeTurn`, `beforeToolCall`, `afterToolCall`, `onStepFinish`, `onChunk` — fire on every turn from all entry paths (WebSocket, `chat()`, `saveMessages`, auto-continuation).

  **`beforeTurn(ctx)`** receives the assembled system prompt, messages, tools, and model. Return a `TurnConfig` to override any part — model, system prompt, messages, tools, activeTools, toolChoice, maxSteps, providerOptions.

  **`maxSteps`** is now a property (default 10) instead of a method. Override per-turn via `TurnConfig.maxSteps`.

  **MCP tools auto-merged** — no need to manually merge `this.mcp.getAITools()` in `getTools()`.

  **Dynamic context blocks:** `Session.addContext()` and `Session.removeContext()` allow adding/removing context blocks after session initialization (e.g., from extensions).

  **Extension manifest expanded** with `context` (namespaced context block declarations) and `hooks` fields.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1256](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1256) [`dfab937`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/dfab937c81b358415e66bda3f8abe76b85d12c11) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add durable fiber execution to the Agent base class.

  `runFiber(name, fn)` registers work in SQLite, holds a `keepAlive` ref, and enables recovery via `onFiberRecovered` after DO eviction. `ctx.stash()` and `this.stash()` checkpoint progress that survives eviction.

  `AIChatAgent` gains `chatRecovery` — when enabled, each chat turn is wrapped in a fiber. `onChatRecovery` provides provider-specific recovery (Workers AI continuation, OpenAI response retrieval, Anthropic synthetic message). `continueLastTurn()` appends to the interrupted assistant message seamlessly.

  `Think` now extends `Agent` directly (no mixin). Fiber support is inherited from the base class.

  **Breaking (experimental APIs only):**

  - Removed `withFibers` mixin (`agents/experimental/forever`)
  - Removed `withDurableChat` mixin (`@cloudflare/ai-chat/experimental/forever`)
  - Removed `./experimental/forever` export from both packages
  - Think no longer has a `fibers` flag — recovery is automatic via alarm housekeeping

### Patch Changes

- [#1259](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1259) [`1933eb4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/1933eb44c48bcb2abf92ef6510359baba138fdca) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Run fiber recovery eagerly in `onStart()` instead of deferring to the next alarm. Interrupted fibers are now detected immediately on the first request after DO wake, with the alarm path as a fallback. A re-entrancy guard prevents double recovery.

- [#1263](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1263) [`e3ceb82`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e3ceb82235f2fb8559031448b4d68db22a2305f5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix `routeAgentEmail()` keeping the target DO non-hibernatable for ~100-120s after `onEmail()` returns. Replaces bare closure RPC targets with a single `RpcTarget` bridge (`EmailBridge`) that has explicit `Symbol.dispose` lifecycle, allowing the runtime to tear down the bidirectional RPC session promptly instead of tying it to the caller's execution context lifetime.

- [`c5ca556`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/c5ca55618bd79042f566e55d1ebbe0636f91e75a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Cap `vite` peer dependency at `>=6.0.0 <9.0.0` to avoid silently accepting untested future major versions.

- [#1271](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1271) [`0cc2dae`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/0cc2daee3fde434442d3ecce4fd21dd26f3d45e9) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add optional `MCPServerFilter` parameter to `getAITools()`, `listTools()`, `listPrompts()`, `listResources()`, and `listResourceTemplates()` for scoping results to specific MCP servers by ID, name, or connection state.

- [#1267](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1267) [`d1ee61a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/d1ee61af77e05625128d1d48fd5316621849fb87) Thanks [@dmmulroy](https://github.com/dmmulroy)! - Fix MCP streamable HTTP client session lifecycle so closing connections explicitly terminates active sessions and persists session IDs across reconnects/restores.

- [#1270](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1270) [`87b4512`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/87b4512985e47de659bf970a65a6d1951f5855fe) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Wire Session into Think as the storage layer, achieving full feature parity with AIChatAgent plus Session-backed advantages.

  **Think (`@cloudflare/think`):**

  - Session integration: `this.messages` backed by `session.getHistory()`, tree-structured messages, context blocks, compaction, FTS5 search
  - `configureSession()` override for context blocks, compaction, search, skills (sync or async)
  - `assembleContext()` returns `{ system, messages }` with context block composition
  - `onChatResponse()` lifecycle hook fires from all turn paths
  - Non-destructive regeneration via `trigger: "regenerate-message"` with Session branching
  - `saveMessages()` for programmatic turn entry (scheduled responses, webhooks, proactive agents)
  - `continueLastTurn()` for extending the last assistant response
  - Custom body persistence across hibernation
  - `sanitizeMessageForPersistence()` hook for PII redaction
  - `messageConcurrency` strategies (queue/latest/merge/drop/debounce)
  - `resetTurnState()` extracted as protected method
  - `chatRecovery` with `runFiber` wrapping on all 4 turn paths
  - `onChatRecovery()` hook with `ChatRecoveryContext`
  - `hasPendingInteraction()` / `waitUntilStable()` for quiescence detection
  - Re-export `Session` from `@cloudflare/think`
  - Constructor wraps `onStart` — subclasses never need `super.onStart()`

  **agents (`agents/chat`):**

  - Extract `AbortRegistry`, `applyToolUpdate` + builders, `parseProtocolMessage` into shared `agents/chat` layer
  - Add `applyChunkToParts` export for fiber recovery

  **AIChatAgent (`@cloudflare/ai-chat`):**

  - Refactor to use shared `AbortRegistry` from `agents/chat`
  - Add `continuation` flag to `OnChatMessageOptions`
  - Export `getAgentMessages()` and tool part helpers
  - Add `getHttpUrl()` to `useAgent` return value

  Replaces scattered ref management in useAgentChat with explicit state
  transitions.

- [#1237](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1237) [`f3d5557`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f3d555797934c6bd15cf5af2678f5e20aa74713a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `TurnQueue` to `agents/chat` — a shared serial async queue with
  generation-based invalidation for chat turn scheduling. AIChatAgent and
  Think now both use `TurnQueue` internally, unifying turn serialization
  and the epoch/clear-generation concept. Think gains proper turn
  serialization (previously concurrent chat turns could interleave).

AIChatAgent's 15 internal auto-continuation fields consolidated into one `ContinuationState` instance (no public API change). Think gains deferred continuations, resume coordination for pending continuations, `onClose` cleanup, and hibernation persistence for client tools via `think_request_context` table.

Previously, `callbackHost` had to be passed explicitly (or read from an env var) because the WebSocket `onMessage` context has no HTTP request to derive the host from. Now the host is automatically extracted from the WebSocket connection's original upgrade URL, so `addMcpServer("name", url)` works without any extra options in callables. Also adds `vite/client` to the shared `agents/tsconfig` types for TS6 compatibility with CSS side-effect imports.

### Minor Changes

- [#1152](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1152) [`16cc622`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/16cc622a25c256c36a1fae061d9558639d3b0cd3) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: expose readable `state` property on `useAgent` and `AgentClient`

  Both `useAgent` (React) and `AgentClient` (vanilla JS) now expose a `state` property that tracks the current agent state. Previously, state was write-only via `setState()` — reading state required manually tracking it through the `onStateUpdate` callback.

  **React (useAgent)**

  ```tsx
  const agent = useAgent<GameAgent, GameState>({
    agent: "game-agent",
    name: "room-123",
  });

  // Read state directly — no need for separate useState + onStateUpdate
  return <div>Score: {agent.state?.score}</div>;

  // Spread for partial updates — works correctly now
  agent.setState({ ...agent.state, score: agent.state.score + 10 });
  ```

  `agent.state` is reactive — the component re-renders when state changes from either the server or client-side `setState()`.

  **Vanilla JS (AgentClient)**

  ```typescript
  const client = new AgentClient<GameAgent>({
    agent: "game-agent",
    name: "room-123",
    host: "your-worker.workers.dev",
  });

  // State updates synchronously on setState and server broadcasts
  client.setState({ score: 100 });
  console.log(client.state); // { score: 100 }
  ```

  **Backward compatible**

  The `onStateUpdate` callback continues to work exactly as before. The new `state` property is additive — it provides a simpler alternative to manual state tracking for the common case.

  **Type: `State | undefined`**

  State starts as `undefined` and is populated when the server sends state on connect (from `initialState`) or when `setState()` is called. Use optional chaining (`agent.state?.field`) for safe access.

- [#1154](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1154) [`74a018a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/74a018a3f09430fc38263b13a0680e9c801bc9f4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: idempotent `schedule()` to prevent row accumulation across DO restarts

  `schedule()` now supports an `idempotent` option that deduplicates by `(type, callback, payload)`, preventing duplicate rows from accumulating when called repeatedly (e.g., in `onStart()`).

  **Cron schedules are idempotent by default.** Calling `schedule("0 * * * *", "tick")` multiple times with the same callback, cron expression, and payload returns the existing schedule instead of creating a duplicate. Set `{ idempotent: false }` to override.

  **Delayed and scheduled (Date) types support opt-in idempotency:**

  ```typescript
  async onStart() {
    // Safe across restarts — only one row exists at a time
    await this.schedule(60, "maintenance", undefined, { idempotent: true });
  }
  ```

  **New warnings for common foot-guns:**

  - `schedule()` called inside `onStart()` without `{ idempotent: true }` now emits a `console.warn` with actionable guidance (once per callback, skipped for cron and when `idempotent` is explicitly set)
  - `alarm()` processing ≥10 stale one-shot rows for the same callback emits a `console.warn` and a `schedule:duplicate_warning` diagnostics channel event

- [#1146](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1146) [`b74e108`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/b74e10855949fb331146b1e1c78fb7860b48493f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: strongly-typed `AgentClient` with `call` inference and `stub` proxy

  `AgentClient` now accepts an optional agent type parameter for full type inference on RPC calls, matching the typed experience that `useAgent` already provides.

  **New: typed `call` and `stub`**

  When an agent type is provided, `call()` infers method names, argument types, and return types from the agent's methods. A new `stub` property provides a direct RPC-style proxy — call agent methods as if they were local functions:

  ```typescript
  const client = new AgentClient<MyAgent>({
    agent: "my-agent",
    host: window.location.host,
  });

  // Typed call — method name autocompletes, args and return type inferred
  const value = await client.call("getValue");

  // Typed stub — direct RPC-style proxy
  await client.stub.getValue();
  await client.stub.add(1, 2);
  ```

  State is automatically inferred from the agent type, so `onStateUpdate` is also typed:

  ```typescript
  const client = new AgentClient<MyAgent>({
    agent: "my-agent",
    host: window.location.host,
    onStateUpdate: (state) => {
      // state is typed as MyAgent's state type
    },
  });
  ```

  **Backward compatible**

  Existing untyped usage continues to work without changes:

  ```typescript
  const client = new AgentClient({ agent: "my-agent", host: "..." });
  client.call("anyMethod", [args]); // still works
  client.call<number>("add", [1, 2]); // explicit return type still works
  client.stub.anyMethod("arg1", 123); // untyped stub also available
  ```

  The previous `AgentClient<State>` pattern is preserved — `new AgentClient<{ count: number }>({...})` still correctly types `onStateUpdate` and leaves `call`/`stub` untyped.

  **Breaking: `call` is now an instance property instead of a prototype method**

  `AgentClient.prototype.call` no longer exists. The `call` function is assigned per-instance in the constructor (via `.bind()`). This is required for the conditional type system to switch between typed and untyped signatures. Normal usage (`client.call(...)`) is unaffected, but code that reflects on the prototype or subclasses that override `call` as a method may need adjustment.

  **Shared type utilities**

  The RPC type utilities (`AgentMethods`, `AgentStub`, `RPCMethods`, etc.) are now exported from `agents/client` so they can be shared between `AgentClient` and `useAgent`, and are available to consumers who need them for advanced typing scenarios.

  - `keepAlive()` no longer creates schedule rows or emits `schedule:create`/`schedule:execute`/`schedule:cancel` observability events — it uses an in-memory ref count and feeds directly into `_scheduleNextAlarm()`
  - multiple concurrent `keepAlive()` callers now share a single alarm cycle instead of each creating their own interval schedule row
  - add `_onAlarmHousekeeping()` hook (called on every alarm cycle) for extensions like the fiber mixin to run housekeeping without coupling to the scheduling system
  - bump internal schema to v2 with a migration that cleans up orphaned `_cf_keepAliveHeartbeat` schedule rows from the previous implementation
  - remove `@experimental` from `keepAlive()` and `keepAliveWhile()`

  The Agent class defined `alarm` as a `public readonly` arrow function property, which completely shadowed PartyServer's `alarm()` prototype method. This meant `#ensureInitialized()` was never called when a Durable Object woke via alarm (e.g. from `scheduleEvery`), causing `this.name` to throw and `onStart` to never run.

  Converted `alarm` from an arrow function property to a regular async method that calls `super.alarm()` before processing scheduled tasks. Also added an `onAlarm()` no-op override to suppress PartyServer's default warning log.

- [#1052](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1052) [`f1e2bfa`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/f1e2bfae1e401a45183e79d59b7453b14fb1cc51) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Make `scheduleEvery()` idempotent

  `scheduleEvery()` now deduplicates by the combination of callback name, interval, and payload: calling it multiple times with the same arguments returns the existing schedule instead of creating a duplicate. A different interval or payload creates a separate, independent schedule.

  This fixes the common pattern of calling `scheduleEvery()` inside `onStart()`, which runs on every Durable Object wake. Previously each wake created a new interval schedule, leading to a thundering herd of duplicate executions.

  New events: `disconnect` (WebSocket close), `email:receive`, `email:reply`, `queue:create`, and a new `agents:email` channel.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1024](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/1024) [`e9ae070`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/e9ae0701fe4312e8221c52881b42968a8a4d0061) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Overhaul observability: `diagnostics_channel`, leaner events, error tracking.

  ### Breaking changes to `agents/observability` types

  - **`BaseEvent`**: Removed `id` and `displayMessage` fields. Events now contain only `type`, `payload`, and `timestamp`. The `payload` type is now strict — accessing undeclared fields is a type error. Narrow on `event.type` before accessing payload properties.
  - **`Observability.emit()`**: Removed the optional `ctx` second parameter.
  - **`AgentObservabilityEvent`**: Split combined union types so each event has its own discriminant (enables proper `Extract`-based type narrowing). Added new error event types.

  If you have a custom `Observability` implementation, update your `emit` signature to `emit(event: ObservabilityEvent): void`.

  ### diagnostics_channel replaces console.log

  The default `genericObservability` implementation no longer logs every event to the console. Instead, events are published to named diagnostics channels using the Node.js `diagnostics_channel` API. Publishing to a channel with no subscribers is a no-op, eliminating logspam.

  Seven named channels, one per event domain:

  - `agents:state` — state sync events
  - `agents:rpc` — RPC method calls and errors
  - `agents:message` — message request/response/clear/cancel/error + tool result/approval
  - `agents:schedule` — schedule and queue create/execute/cancel/retry/error events
  - `agents:lifecycle` — connection and destroy events
  - `agents:workflow` — workflow start/event/approve/reject/terminate/pause/resume/restart
  - `agents:mcp` — MCP client connect/authorize/discover events

  ### New error events

  Error events are now emitted at failure sites instead of (or alongside) `console.error`:

  - `rpc:error` — RPC method failures (includes method name and error message)
  - `schedule:error` — schedule callback failures after all retries exhausted
  - `queue:error` — queue callback failures after all retries exhausted

  ### Reduced boilerplate

  All 20+ inline `emit` blocks in the Agent class have been replaced with a private `_emit()` helper that auto-generates timestamps, reducing each call site from ~10 lines to 1.

  ### Typed subscribe helper

  A new `subscribe()` function is exported from `agents/observability` with full type narrowing per channel:

  ```ts
  import { subscribe } from "agents/observability";

  const unsub = subscribe("rpc", (event) => {
    // event is fully typed as rpc | rpc:error
    console.log(event.payload.method);
  });
  ```

  ### Tail Worker integration

  In production, all diagnostics channel messages are automatically forwarded to Tail Workers via `event.diagnosticsChannelEvents` — no subscription needed in the agent itself.

  ### TracingChannel potential

  The `diagnostics_channel` API also provides `TracingChannel` for start/end/error spans with `AsyncLocalStorage` integration, opening the door to end-to-end tracing of RPC calls, workflow steps, and schedule executions.

Keeps the Durable Object alive via alarm heartbeats (every 30 seconds), preventing idle eviction during long-running work. `keepAlive()` returns a disposer function; `keepAliveWhile(fn)` runs an async function and automatically cleans up the heartbeat when it completes.

  `AIChatAgent` now automatically calls `keepAliveWhile()` during `_reply()` streaming, preventing idle eviction during long LLM generations.

  - **JSON-RPC error responses**: `RPCServerTransport.handle()` now returns a proper JSON-RPC `-32600 Invalid Request` error response for malformed messages instead of throwing an unhandled exception. This aligns with the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec requirement that servers respond with error objects.
  - **McpAgent protocol message suppression**: `McpAgent` now overrides `shouldSendProtocolMessages()` to suppress `CF_AGENT_IDENTITY`, `CF_AGENT_STATE`, and `CF_AGENT_MCP_SERVERS` frames on MCP transport connections (detected via the `cf-mcp-method` header). Regular WebSocket connections to a hybrid McpAgent are unaffected.
  - **CORS warning removed**: Removed the one-time warning about `Authorization` in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` with wildcard origin. The warning was noisy and unhelpful — the combination is valid for non-credentialed requests and does not pose a real security risk.

  **`agents`**: Added `MCPClientManager.waitForConnections(options?)` which awaits all in-flight connection and discovery operations. Accepts an optional `{ timeout }` in milliseconds. Background restore promises from `restoreConnectionsFromStorage()` are now tracked so callers can wait for them to settle.

  **`@cloudflare/ai-chat`**: Added `waitForMcpConnections` opt-in config on `AIChatAgent`. Set to `true` to wait indefinitely, or `{ timeout: 10_000 }` to cap the wait. Default is `false` (non-blocking, preserving existing behavior). For lower-level control, call `this.mcp.waitForConnections()` directly in your `onChatMessage`.

  Previously, SQL errors from `this.sql` were passed to `this.onError()`, which by default logged the error and re-threw it. This caused confusing double error logs and made it impossible to catch SQL errors with a simple try/catch around `this.sql` calls if `onError` was overridden to swallow errors.

  Now, `this.sql` wraps failures in `SqlError` (which includes the query string for debugging) and throws directly. The `onError` lifecycle hook is reserved for WebSocket connection errors and unhandled server errors, not SQL errors.

  Previously, throwing an error inside a workflow's `run()` method would halt the workflow but never notify the Agent via `onWorkflowError`. Only explicit `step.reportError()` calls triggered the callback, but those did not halt the workflow.

  Now, unhandled errors in `run()` are automatically caught and reported to the Agent before re-throwing. A double-notification guard (`_errorReported` flag) ensures that if `step.reportError()` was already called before the throw, the auto-report is skipped.

Previously, calling `addMcpServer` with the same name but a different URL would silently return the stale connection. Now each unique (name, URL) pair is treated as a separate connection. RPC transport continues to dedup by name only.

  - **SSRF protection**: MCP client now validates URLs before connecting, blocking private/internal IP addresses (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints, IPv6 unique local and link-local ranges)
  - **OAuth log redaction**: Removed OAuth state parameter value from `consumeState` warning logs to prevent sensitive data leakage
  - **Error sanitization**: MCP server error strings are now sanitized (control characters stripped, truncated to 500 chars) before broadcasting to clients to mitigate XSS risk
  - **`sendIdentityOnConnect` warning**: When using custom routing (where the instance name is not visible in the URL), a one-time console warning now informs developers that the instance name is being sent to clients. Set `static options = { sendIdentityOnConnect: false }` to opt out, or `true` to silence the warning.

  Email servers normalize addresses to lowercase, so `SomeAgent+id@domain.com` arrives as `someagent+id@domain.com`. The router now registers a lowercase key in addition to the original binding name and kebab-case version, so all three forms resolve correctly.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#565](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/565) [`0e9a607`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/0e9a607888a4ef31adc226d0fa939b9125cbfea0) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - Add RPC transport for MCP: connect an Agent to an McpAgent via Durable Object bindings

  **New feature: `addMcpServer` with DO binding**

  Agents can now connect to McpAgent instances in the same Worker using RPC transport — no HTTP, no network overhead. Pass the Durable Object namespace directly:

  ```typescript
  // In your Agent
  await this.addMcpServer("counter", env.MY_MCP);

  // With props
  await this.addMcpServer("counter", env.MY_MCP, {
    props: { userId: "user-123", role: "admin" },
  });
  ```

  The `addMcpServer` method now accepts `string | DurableObjectNamespace` as the second parameter with proper TypeScript overloads, so HTTP and RPC paths are type-safe and cannot be mixed.

  **Hibernation support**

  RPC connections survive Durable Object hibernation automatically. The binding name and props are persisted to storage and restored on wake-up, matching the behavior of HTTP MCP connections. No need to manually re-establish connections in `onStart()`.

  **Deduplication**

  Calling `addMcpServer` with the same server name multiple times (e.g., across hibernation cycles) now returns the existing connection instead of creating duplicates. This applies to both RPC and HTTP connections. Connection IDs are stable across hibernation restore.

  **Other changes**

  - Rewrote `RPCClientTransport` to accept a `DurableObjectNamespace` and create the stub internally via `getServerByName` from partyserver, instead of requiring a pre-constructed stub
  - Rewrote `RPCServerTransport` to drop session management (unnecessary for DO-scoped RPC) and use `JSONRPCMessageSchema` from the MCP SDK for validation instead of 170 lines of hand-written validation
  - Removed `_resolveRpcBinding`, `_buildRpcTransportOptions`, `_buildHttpTransportOptions`, and `_connectToMcpServerInternal` from the Agent base class — RPC transport logic no longer leaks into `index.ts`
  - Added `AddRpcMcpServerOptions` type (discriminated from `AddMcpServerOptions`) so `props` is only available when passing a binding
  - Added `RPC_DO_PREFIX` constant used consistently across all RPC naming
  - Fixed `MCPClientManager.callTool` passing `serverId` through to `conn.client.callTool` (it should be stripped before the call)
  - Added `getRpcServersFromStorage()` and `saveRpcServerToStorage()` to `MCPClientManager` for hibernation persistence
  - `restoreConnectionsFromStorage` now skips RPC servers (restored separately by the Agent class which has access to `env`)
  - Reduced `rpc.ts` from 609 lines to 245 lines
  - Reduced `types.ts` from 108 lines to 26 lines
  - Updated `mcp-rpc-transport` example to use Workers AI (no API keys needed), Kumo/agents-ui components, and Tailwind CSS
  - Updated MCP transports documentation

  Previously, `addMcpServer()` always required a `callbackHost` (either explicitly or derived from the request context) and eagerly created an OAuth auth provider, even when connecting to MCP servers that do not use OAuth. This made simple non-OAuth connections unnecessarily difficult, especially from WebSocket callable methods where the request context origin is unreliable.

  Now, `callbackHost` and the OAuth auth provider are only required when the MCP server actually needs OAuth (returns a 401/AUTHENTICATING state). For non-OAuth servers, `addMcpServer("name", url)` works with no additional options. If an OAuth server is encountered without a `callbackHost`, a clear error is thrown: "This MCP server requires OAuth authentication. Provide callbackHost in addMcpServer options to enable the OAuth flow."

  The restore-from-storage flow also handles missing callback URLs gracefully, skipping auth provider creation for non-OAuth servers.

Errors with an active connection properly transition to "failed" state and are surfaced to clients via WebSocket broadcast.

## 0.5.0

This release adds per-connection protocol message control and a built-in retry system. Agents can now suppress JSON protocol frames for binary-only clients (MQTT, IoT devices) while keeping RPC and regular messaging working — useful for Durable Objects that serve mixed connection types. The new `this.retry()` method and per-task retry options bring exponential backoff with jitter to scheduling, queues, and MCP connections without external dependencies. This release also improves scheduling ergonomics with synchronous getter methods, a cleaner discriminated union schema, and fixes for hibernation, deep type recursion, and SSE keepalives.

### Minor Changes

  Adds the ability to suppress protocol messages (`CF_AGENT_IDENTITY`, `CF_AGENT_STATE`, `CF_AGENT_MCP_SERVERS`) on a per-connection basis. This is useful for binary-only clients (e.g. MQTT devices) that cannot handle JSON text frames.

  Override `shouldSendProtocolMessages(connection, ctx)` to return `false` for connections that should not receive protocol messages. These connections still fully participate in RPC and regular messaging — only the automatic protocol text frames are suppressed, both on connect and during broadcasts.

  Use `isConnectionProtocolEnabled(connection)` to check a connection's protocol status at any time.

  Also fixes `isConnectionReadonly` to correctly survive Durable Object hibernation by re-wrapping the connection when the in-memory accessor cache has been cleared.

  - `this.retry(fn, options?)` — retry any async operation with exponential backoff and jitter. Accepts optional `shouldRetry` predicate to bail early on non-retryable errors.
  - `queue()`, `schedule()`, `scheduleEvery()` accept `{ retry?: RetryOptions }` for per-task retry configuration, persisted in SQLite alongside the task.
  - `addMcpServer()` accepts `{ retry?: RetryOptions }` for configurable MCP connection retries.
  - `RetryOptions` type is exported for TypeScript consumers.
  - Retry options are validated eagerly at enqueue/schedule time — invalid values throw immediately.
  - Class-level retry defaults via `static options = { retry: { ... } }` — override defaults for an entire agent class.
  - Internal retries added for workflow operations (`terminateWorkflow`, `pauseWorkflow`, etc.) with Durable Object-aware error detection.

  - Change `zod/v3` import to `zod` so the package works for users on zod v3 (who don't have the `zod/v3` subpath).
  - Replace flat object with optional fields with a `z.discriminatedUnion` on `when.type`. Each scheduling variant now only contains the fields it needs, making the schema cleaner and easier for LLMs to follow.
  - Replace `z.coerce.date()` with `z.string()`. Zod v4's `toJSONSchema()` cannot represent `Date`, and the AI SDK routes zod v4 schemas through it directly. Dates are now returned as ISO 8601 strings.
  - **Type change:** `Schedule["when"]` is now a discriminated union instead of a flat object with optional fields. `when.date` is `string` instead of `Date`.

  The GET SSE handler already sends `event: ping` every 30 seconds to keep the connection alive, but the POST SSE handler did not.

  `getQueue()`, `getQueues()`, `getSchedule()`, `dequeue()`, `dequeueAll()`, and `dequeueAllByCallback()` were unnecessarily `async` despite only performing synchronous SQL operations. They now return values directly instead of wrapping them in Promises. This is backward compatible — existing code using `await` on these methods will continue to work.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#890](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/890) [`22dbd2c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/22dbd2c70445be185bd106abb1638c2071419c11) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fix `_flushQueue()` permanently blocking when a queued callback throws

  A throwing callback in `_flushQueue()` previously caused the failing row to never be dequeued, creating an infinite retry loop that blocked all subsequent queued tasks. Additionally, `_flushingQueue` was never reset to `false` on error, permanently locking the queue for the lifetime of the Durable Object instance.

  The fix wraps each callback invocation in try-catch-finally so that failing items are always dequeued and subsequent items continue processing. The `_flushingQueue` flag is now reset in a top-level finally block. Missing callbacks are also dequeued instead of being skipped indefinitely.

  **Note for existing stuck Durable Objects:** This fix is self-healing for poison rows — they will be properly dequeued on the next `_flushQueue()` call. However, `_flushQueue()` is only triggered by a new `queue()` call, not on DO initialization. If you have DOs stuck in production, you can either trigger a new `queue()` call on affected DOs, or call `dequeueAll()`/`dequeueAllByCallback()` to clear the poison rows manually. A future improvement may add a `_flushQueue()` call to `onStart()` so stuck DOs self-heal on wake.

  Re-export `agentContext` as `__DO_NOT_USE_WILL_BREAK__agentContext` from the main `agents` entry point and update `@cloudflare/ai-chat` to import it from `agents` instead of the `agents/internal_context` subpath export. This prevents Vite SSR pre-bundling from creating two separate `AsyncLocalStorage` instances, which caused `getCurrentAgent().connection` to be `undefined` inside `onChatMessage` and tool `execute` functions.

  The `agents/internal_context` subpath export has been removed from `package.json` and the deprecated `agentContext` alias has been removed from `internal_context.ts`. This was never a public API.

Updated examples for stateless MCP Servers create new `McpServer` instance per request instead of sharing a single instance.

  **Breaking changes for x402 users:**

  - Peer dependencies changed: replace `x402` with `@x402/core` and `@x402/evm`
  - `PaymentRequirements` type now uses v2 fields (e.g. `amount` instead of `maxAmountRequired`)
  - `X402ClientConfig.account` type changed from `viem.Account` to `ClientEvmSigner` (structurally compatible with `privateKeyToAccount()`)

  **Migration guide:**

  1. Update dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm uninstall x402
     npm install @x402/core @x402/evm
     ```

  2. Update network identifiers — both legacy names and CAIP-2 format are accepted:

     ```typescript
     // Before
     {
       network: "base-sepolia";
     }
     // After (either works)
     {
       network: "base-sepolia";
     } // legacy name, auto-converted
     {
       network: "eip155:84532";
     } // CAIP-2 format (preferred)
     ```

  3. If you access `PaymentRequirements` fields in callbacks, update to v2 field names (see `@x402/core` docs).
  4. The `version` field on `X402Config` and `X402ClientConfig` is now deprecated and ignored — the protocol version is determined automatically.

  **Other changes:**

  - `X402ClientConfig.network` is now optional — the client auto-selects from available payment requirements
  - Server-side lazy initialization: facilitator connection is deferred until the first paid tool invocation
  - Payment tokens support both v2 (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`) and v1 (`X-PAYMENT`) HTTP headers
  - Added `normalizeNetwork` export for converting legacy network names to CAIP-2 format
  - Re-exports `PaymentRequirements`, `PaymentRequired`, `Network`, `FacilitatorConfig`, and `ClientEvmSigner` from `agents/x402`

  The `run()` method wrapper was being set as an instance property in the constructor, but Cloudflare's RPC system invokes methods from the prototype chain. This caused the initialization wrapper to be bypassed in production, resulting in `_initAgent` never being called.

  Changed to wrap the subclass prototype's `run` method directly with proper safeguards:

  - Uses `Object.hasOwn()` to only wrap prototypes that define their own `run` method (prevents double-wrapping inherited methods)
  - Uses a `WeakSet` to track wrapped prototypes (prevents re-wrapping on subsequent instantiations)
  - Uses an instance-level `__agentInitCalled` flag to prevent double initialization if `super.run()` is called from a subclass

  Previously, calling `client.close()` would not reject pending RPC calls until the WebSocket close handshake completed (which could take 15+ seconds in some environments). Now pending calls are rejected immediately when `close()` is called, providing faster feedback on intentional disconnects.

## Cloudflare Workflows Integration

Agents excel at real-time communication and state management. Workflows excel at durable execution. Together, they enable powerful patterns where Agents handle WebSocket connections while Workflows handle long-running tasks, retries, and human-in-the-loop flows.

### AgentWorkflow Base Class

Extend `AgentWorkflow` instead of `WorkflowEntrypoint` to get typed access to the originating Agent:

```typescript
import { AgentWorkflow } from "agents/workflows";

export class ProcessingWorkflow extends AgentWorkflow<MyAgent, TaskParams> {
  async run(event: AgentWorkflowEvent<TaskParams>, step: AgentWorkflowStep) {
    // Call Agent methods via RPC
    await this.agent.updateStatus(params.taskId, "processing");

    // Non-durable: progress reporting
    await this.reportProgress({ step: "process", percent: 0.5 });
    this.broadcastToClients({ type: "update", taskId: params.taskId });

    // Durable via step: idempotent, won't repeat on retry
    await step.mergeAgentState({ taskProgress: 0.5 });
    await step.reportComplete(result);

    return result;
  }
}
```

### Agent Methods for Workflows

- `runWorkflow(workflowName, params, options?)` - Start workflow with optional metadata
- `sendWorkflowEvent(workflowName, workflowId, event)` - Send events to waiting workflows
- `getWorkflow(workflowId)` / `getWorkflows(criteria?)` - Query workflows with cursor-based pagination
- `deleteWorkflow(workflowId)` / `deleteWorkflows(criteria?)` - Delete workflows by ID or criteria
- `approveWorkflow(workflowId)` / `rejectWorkflow(workflowId)` - Human-in-the-loop approval flows
- `terminateWorkflow()`, `pauseWorkflow()`, `resumeWorkflow()`, `restartWorkflow()` - Workflow control

### Lifecycle Callbacks

```typescript
async onWorkflowProgress(workflowName, workflowId, progress) {}
async onWorkflowComplete(workflowName, workflowId, result?) {}
async onWorkflowError(workflowName, workflowId, error) {}
async onWorkflowEvent(workflowName, workflowId, event) {}
```

See `docs/workflows.md` for full documentation.

## Secure Email Reply Routing

Prevents unauthorized routing of emails to arbitrary agent instances using HMAC-SHA256 signed headers.

### New Resolver

```typescript
import { createSecureReplyEmailResolver } from "agents/email";

const resolver = createSecureReplyEmailResolver(env.EMAIL_SECRET, {
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // Optional: 7 days (default: 30 days)
  onInvalidSignature: (email, reason) => {
    console.warn(`Invalid signature from ${email.from}: ${reason}`);
  },
});
```

### Automatic Signing on Reply

```typescript
await this.replyToEmail(email, {
  fromName: "My Agent",
  body: "Thanks!",
  secret: this.env.EMAIL_SECRET, // Signs headers for secure reply routing
});
```

### Breaking Changes

- Email utilities moved to `agents/email` subpath
- `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver` removed (security vulnerability)
- New `onNoRoute` callback for handling unmatched emails

---

## State Management Improvements

### Synchronous `setState()`

`setState()` is now synchronous. Existing `await this.setState(...)` code continues to work.

```typescript
// Preferred (new)
this.setState({ count: 1 });

// Still works (backward compatible)
await this.setState({ count: 1 });
```

### `validateStateChange()` Hook

New synchronous validation hook that runs before state is persisted:

```typescript
validateStateChange(nextState: State, source: Connection | "server") {
  if (nextState.count < 0) {
    throw new Error("Count cannot be negative");
  }
}
```

### Execution Order

1. `validateStateChange(nextState, source)` - validation (sync, gating)
2. State persisted to SQLite
3. State broadcast to connected clients
4. `onStateUpdate(nextState, source)` - notifications (async via `ctx.waitUntil`, non-gating)

---

## Scheduling: `scheduleEvery()`

Fixed-interval recurring tasks with overlap prevention and error resilience:

```typescript
await this.scheduleEvery(60, "cleanup");
await this.scheduleEvery(300, "syncData", { source: "api" });
```

- Validates interval doesn't exceed 30 days (DO alarm limit)
- Overlap prevention with hung callback detection (configurable via `hungScheduleTimeoutSeconds`)

---

## Callable System Improvements

### Client-side RPC Timeout

```typescript
await agent.call("method", [args], {
  timeout: 5000,
  stream: { onChunk, onDone, onError },
});
```

### New Features

- `StreamingResponse.error(message)` - Graceful stream error signaling
- `getCallableMethods()` - Introspection API for callable methods
- Connection close handling - Pending calls rejected on disconnect
- `crypto.randomUUID()` for more robust RPC IDs
- Streaming observability events and error logging

---

## MCP Server API

Options-based `addMcpServer()` overload for cleaner configuration:

```typescript
await this.addMcpServer("server", url, {
  callbackHost: "https://my-worker.workers.dev",
  transport: { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." } },
});
```

---

## Routing & Identity Enhancements

- **`basePath`** - Bypass default URL construction for custom routing
- **Server-sent identity** - Agents send `name` and `agent` type on connect
- **`onIdentity` / `onIdentityChange`** callbacks on the client
- **`static options = { sendIdentityOnConnect }`** for server-side control

```typescript
const agent = useAgent({
  basePath: "user",
  onIdentity: (name, agentType) => console.log(`Connected to ${name}`),
});
```

---

## Email Utilities

- **`isAutoReplyEmail(headers)`** - Detect auto-reply emails using standard RFC headers

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed tool error content type in `getAITools` (#781)
- Fixed React `useRef` type error
- Memory leak prevention with WeakMap for callable metadata
- Connection cleanup - pending RPC calls rejected on WebSocket close
- JSON parse error handling - graceful fallback to `initialState` on corrupted state
- Fixed resumable streaming to avoid delivering live chunks before resume ACK (#795)

---

## Migration Notes

### Email Imports

```typescript
// Before
import { createAddressBasedEmailResolver, signAgentHeaders } from "agents";

// After
import {
  createAddressBasedEmailResolver,
  signAgentHeaders,
} from "agents/email";
```

### Workflow Imports

```typescript
import { AgentWorkflow } from "agents/workflows";
import type { AgentWorkflowStep, WorkflowInfo } from "agents/workflows";
```

### OpenAI Provider Options

When using `scheduleSchema` with OpenAI models via the AI SDK, pass `providerOptions`:

```typescript
await generateObject({
  // ... other options
  providerOptions: { openai: { strictJsonSchema: false } },
});
```

  Adds seamless integration between Cloudflare Agents and Cloudflare Workflows for durable, multi-step background processing.

  ### Why use Workflows with Agents?

  Agents excel at real-time communication and state management, while Workflows excel at durable execution. Together:

  - Agents handle WebSocket connections and quick operations
  - Workflows handle long-running tasks, retries, and human-in-the-loop flows

  ### AgentWorkflow Base Class

  Extend `AgentWorkflow` instead of `WorkflowEntrypoint` to get typed access to the originating Agent:

  ```typescript
  export class ProcessingWorkflow extends AgentWorkflow<MyAgent, TaskParams> {
    async run(event: AgentWorkflowEvent<TaskParams>, step: AgentWorkflowStep) {
      const params = event.payload;

      // Call Agent methods via RPC
      await this.agent.updateStatus(params.taskId, "processing");

      // Non-durable: progress reporting (lightweight, for frequent updates)
      await this.reportProgress({
        step: "process",
        percent: 0.5,
        message: "Halfway done",
      });
      this.broadcastToClients({ type: "update", taskId: params.taskId });

      // Durable via step: idempotent, won't repeat on retry
      await step.mergeAgentState({ taskProgress: 0.5 });
      await step.reportComplete(result);

      return result;
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Agent Methods

  - `runWorkflow(workflowName, params, options?)` - Start workflow with optional metadata for querying
  - `sendWorkflowEvent(workflowName, workflowId, event)` - Send events to waiting workflows
  - `getWorkflow(workflowId)` - Get tracked workflow by ID
  - `getWorkflows(criteria?)` - Query by status, workflowName, or metadata with pagination
  - `deleteWorkflow(workflowId)` - Delete a workflow tracking record
  - `deleteWorkflows(criteria?)` - Delete workflows by criteria (status, workflowName, metadata, createdBefore)
  - `approveWorkflow(workflowId, data?)` - Approve a waiting workflow
  - `rejectWorkflow(workflowId, data?)` - Reject a waiting workflow

  ### AgentWorkflow Methods

  **On `this` (non-durable, lightweight):**

  - `reportProgress(progress)` - Report typed progress object to Agent
  - `broadcastToClients(message)` - Broadcast to WebSocket clients
  - `waitForApproval(step, opts?)` - Wait for approval (throws on rejection)

  **On `step` (durable, idempotent):**

  - `step.reportComplete(result?)` - Report successful completion
  - `step.reportError(error)` - Report an error
  - `step.sendEvent(event)` - Send custom event to Agent
  - `step.updateAgentState(state)` - Replace Agent state (broadcasts to clients)
  - `step.mergeAgentState(partial)` - Merge into Agent state (broadcasts to clients)
  - `step.resetAgentState()` - Reset Agent state to initialState (broadcasts to clients)

  ### Lifecycle Callbacks

  Override these methods to handle workflow events (workflowName is first for easy differentiation):

  ```typescript
  async onWorkflowProgress(workflowName, workflowId, progress) {} // progress is typed object
  async onWorkflowComplete(workflowName, workflowId, result?) {}
  async onWorkflowError(workflowName, workflowId, error) {}
  async onWorkflowEvent(workflowName, workflowId, event) {}
  ```

  ### Workflow Tracking

  Workflows are automatically tracked in `cf_agents_workflows` SQLite table:

  - Status, timestamps, errors
  - Optional `metadata` field for queryable key-value data
  - Params/output NOT stored by default (could be large)

  See `docs/workflows.md` for full documentation.

- [#812](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/812) [`6218541`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6218541e9c1e40ccbaa25b2d9d93858c0ad81ffa) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - # Bug Fixes

  This release includes three bug fixes:

  ## 1. Hung Callback Detection in scheduleEvery()

  Fixed a deadlock where if an interval callback hung indefinitely, all future interval executions would be skipped forever.

  **Fix:** Track execution start time and force reset after 30 seconds of inactivity. If a previous execution appears hung (started more than 30s ago), it is force-reset and re-executed.

  ```typescript
  // Now safe - hung callbacks won't block future executions
  await this.scheduleEvery(60, "myCallback");
  ```

  ## 2. Corrupted State Recovery

  Fixed a crash when the database contains malformed JSON state.

  **Fix:** Wrapped `JSON.parse` in try-catch with fallback to `initialState`. If parsing fails, the agent logs an error and recovers gracefully.

  ```typescript
  // Agent now survives corrupted state
  class MyAgent extends Agent {
    initialState = { count: 0 }; // Used as fallback if DB state is corrupted
  }
  ```

  ## 3. getCallableMethods() Prototype Chain Traversal

  Fixed `getCallableMethods()` to find `@callable` methods from parent classes, not just the immediate class.

  **Fix:** Walk the full prototype chain using `Object.getPrototypeOf()` loop.

  ```typescript
  class BaseAgent extends Agent {
    @callable()
    parentMethod() {
      return "parent";
    }
  }

  class ChildAgent extends BaseAgent {
    @callable()
    childMethod() {
      return "child";
    }
  }

  // Now correctly returns both parentMethod and childMethod
  const methods = childAgent.getCallableMethods();
  ```

- [#812](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/812) [`6218541`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6218541e9c1e40ccbaa25b2d9d93858c0ad81ffa) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - # Callable System Improvements

  This release includes several improvements to the `@callable` decorator and RPC system:

  ## New Features

  ### Client-side RPC Timeout

  You can now specify a timeout for RPC calls that will reject if the call doesn't complete in time:

  ```typescript
  await agent.call("slowMethod", [], { timeout: 5000 });
  ```

  ### StreamingResponse.error()

  New method to gracefully signal an error during streaming and close the stream:

  ```typescript
  @callable({ streaming: true })
  async processItems(stream: StreamingResponse, items: string[]) {
    for (const item of items) {
      try {
        const result = await this.process(item);
        stream.send(result);
      } catch (e) {
        stream.error(`Failed to process ${item}: ${e.message}`);
        return;
      }
    }
    stream.end();
  }
  ```

  ### getCallableMethods() API

  New method on the Agent class to introspect all callable methods and their metadata:

  ```typescript
  const methods = agent.getCallableMethods();
  // Returns Map<string, CallableMetadata>

  for (const [name, meta] of methods) {
    console.log(`${name}: ${meta.description || "(no description)"}`);
  }
  ```

  ### Connection Close Handling

  Pending RPC calls are now automatically rejected with a "Connection closed" error when the WebSocket connection closes unexpectedly.

  ## Internal Improvements

  - **WeakMap for metadata storage**: Changed `callableMetadata` from `Map` to `WeakMap` to prevent memory leaks when function references are garbage collected.
  - **UUID for RPC IDs**: Replaced `Math.random().toString(36)` with `crypto.randomUUID()` for more robust and unique RPC call identifiers.
  - **Streaming observability**: Added observability events for streaming RPC calls.

  ## API Enhancements

  The `agent.call()` method now accepts a unified `CallOptions` object with timeout support:

  ```typescript
  // New format (preferred, supports timeout)
  await agent.call("method", [args], {
    timeout: 5000,
    stream: { onChunk, onDone, onError },
  });

  // Legacy format (still fully supported for backward compatibility)
  await agent.call("method", [args], { onChunk, onDone, onError });
  ```

  Both formats work seamlessly - the client auto-detects which format you're using.

- [#812](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/812) [`6218541`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6218541e9c1e40ccbaa25b2d9d93858c0ad81ffa) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: Add `scheduleEvery` method for fixed-interval scheduling

  Adds a new `scheduleEvery(intervalSeconds, callback, payload?)` method to the Agent class for scheduling recurring tasks at fixed intervals.

  ### Features

  - **Fixed interval execution**: Schedule a callback to run every N seconds
  - **Overlap prevention**: If a callback is still running when the next interval fires, the next execution is skipped
  - **Error resilience**: If a callback throws, the schedule persists and continues on the next interval
  - **Cancellable**: Use `cancelSchedule(id)` to stop the recurring schedule

  ### Usage

  ```typescript
  class MyAgent extends Agent {
    async onStart() {
      // Run cleanup every 60 seconds
      await this.scheduleEvery(60, "cleanup");

      // With payload
      await this.scheduleEvery(300, "syncData", { source: "api" });
    }

    cleanup() {
      // Runs every 60 seconds
    }

    syncData(payload: { source: string }) {
      // Runs every 300 seconds with payload
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Querying interval schedules

  ```typescript
  // Get all interval schedules
  const intervals = await this.getSchedules({ type: "interval" });
  ```

  ### Schema changes

  Adds `intervalSeconds` and `running` columns to `cf_agents_schedules` table (auto-migrated for existing agents).

  Detects auto-reply emails based on standard RFC 3834 headers (`Auto-Submitted`, `X-Auto-Response-Suppress`, `Precedence`). Use this to avoid mail loops when sending automated replies.

  ```typescript
  import { isAutoReplyEmail } from "agents/email";
  import PostalMime from "postal-mime";

  async onEmail(email: AgentEmail) {
    const raw = await email.getRaw();
    const parsed = await PostalMime.parse(raw);

    // Detect and skip auto-reply emails
    if (isAutoReplyEmail(parsed.headers)) {
      console.log("Skipping auto-reply");
      return;
    }

    // Process the email...
  }
  ```

- [#812](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/812) [`6218541`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6218541e9c1e40ccbaa25b2d9d93858c0ad81ffa) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: improve type inference for RPC methods returning custom interfaces

  Previously, `RPCMethod` used `{ [key: string]: SerializableValue }` to check if return types were serializable. This didn't work with TypeScript interfaces that have named properties (like `interface CoreState { counter: number; name: string; }`), causing those methods to be incorrectly excluded from typed RPC calls.

  Now uses a recursive `CanSerialize<T>` type that checks if all properties of an object are serializable, properly supporting:

  - Custom interfaces with named properties
  - Nested object types
  - Arrays of objects
  - Optional and nullable properties
  - Union types

  Also expanded `NonSerializable` to explicitly exclude non-JSON-serializable types like `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`, `Error`, and typed arrays.

  ```typescript
  // Before: these methods were NOT recognized as callable
  interface MyState {
    counter: number;
    items: string[];
  }

  class MyAgent extends Agent<Env, MyState> {
    @callable()

  Previously, when a workflow reported progress, completion, or errors via callbacks, the `cf_agents_workflows` tracking table was not updated. This caused `getWorkflow()` and `getWorkflows()` to return stale status (e.g., "queued" instead of "running" or "complete").

  Now, `onWorkflowCallback()` automatically updates the tracking table:

  - Progress callbacks set status to "running"
  - Complete callbacks set status to "complete" with `completed_at` timestamp
  - Error callbacks set status to "errored" with error details

  Fixes #821.

  Adds a cleaner options-based overload for `addMcpServer()` that avoids passing `undefined` for unused positional parameters.

  ### Before (still works)

  ```typescript
  // Awkward when you only need transport options
  await this.addMcpServer("server", url, undefined, undefined, {
    transport: { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." } },
  });
  ```

  ### After (preferred)

  ```typescript
  // Clean options object
  await this.addMcpServer("server", url, {
    transport: { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." } },
  });

  // With callback host
  await this.addMcpServer("server", url, {
    callbackHost: "https://my-worker.workers.dev",
    transport: { type: "sse" },
  });
  ```

  ### Options

  ```typescript
  type AddMcpServerOptions = {
    callbackHost?: string; // OAuth callback host (auto-derived if omitted)
    agentsPrefix?: string; // Routing prefix (default: "agents")
    client?: ClientOptions; // MCP client options
    transport?: {
      headers?: HeadersInit; // Custom headers for auth
      type?: "sse" | "streamable-http" | "auto";
    };
  };
  ```

  The legacy 5-parameter signature remains fully supported for backward compatibility.

- [#812](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/812) [`6218541`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/6218541e9c1e40ccbaa25b2d9d93858c0ad81ffa) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add custom URL routing with `basePath` and server-sent identity

  ## Custom URL Routing with `basePath`

  New `basePath` option bypasses default `/agents/{agent}/{name}` URL construction, enabling custom routing patterns:

  ```typescript
  // Client connects to /user instead of /agents/user-agent/...
  const agent = useAgent({
    agent: "UserAgent",
    basePath: "user",
  });
  ```

  Server handles routing manually with `getAgentByName`:

  ```typescript
  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
      const url = new URL(request.url);

      if (url.pathname === "/user") {
        const session = await getSession(request);
        const agent = await getAgentByName(env.UserAgent, session.userId);
        return agent.fetch(request);
      }

      return (
        (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ??
        new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
      );
    },
  };
  ```

  ## Server-Sent Identity

  Agents now send their identity (`name` and `agent` class) to clients on connect:

  - `onIdentity` callback - called when server sends identity
  - `agent.name` and `agent.agent` are updated from server (authoritative)

  ```typescript
  const agent = useAgent({
    agent: "UserAgent",
    basePath: "user",
    onIdentity: (name, agentType) => {
      console.log(`Connected to ${agentType} instance: ${name}`);
    },
  });
  ```

  ## Identity State & Ready Promise

  - `identified: boolean` - whether identity has been received
  - `ready: Promise<void>` - resolves when identity is received
  - In React, `name`, `agent`, and `identified` are reactive state

  ```typescript
  // React - reactive rendering
  return agent.identified ? `Connected to: ${agent.name}` : "Connecting...";

  // Vanilla JS - await ready
  await agent.ready;
  console.log(agent.name);
  ```

  ## Identity Change Detection

  - `onIdentityChange` callback - fires when identity differs on reconnect
  - Warns if identity changes without handler (helps catch session issues)

  ```typescript
  useAgent({
    basePath: "user",
    onIdentityChange: (oldName, newName, oldAgent, newAgent) => {
      console.log(`Session changed: ${oldName} → ${newName}`);
    },
  });
  ```

  ## Sub-Paths with `path` Option

  Append additional path segments:

  ```typescript
  // /user/settings
  useAgent({ basePath: "user", path: "settings" });

  // /agents/my-agent/room/settings
  useAgent({ agent: "MyAgent", name: "room", path: "settings" });
  ```

  ## Server-Side Identity Control

  Disable identity sending for security-sensitive instance names:

  ```typescript
  class SecureAgent extends Agent {
    static options = { sendIdentityOnConnect: false };
  }
  ```

  This release introduces secure email reply routing with HMAC-SHA256 signed headers, preventing unauthorized routing of emails to arbitrary agent instances.

  #### Breaking Changes

  **Email utilities moved to `agents/email` subpath**: Email-specific resolvers and utilities have been moved to a dedicated subpath for better organization.

  ```ts
  // Before
  import { createAddressBasedEmailResolver, signAgentHeaders } from "agents";

  // After
  import {
    createAddressBasedEmailResolver,
    signAgentHeaders,
  } from "agents/email";
  ```

  The following remain in root: `routeAgentEmail`, `createHeaderBasedEmailResolver` (deprecated).

  **`createHeaderBasedEmailResolver` removed**: This function now throws an error with migration guidance. It was removed because it trusted attacker-controlled email headers for routing.

  **Migration:**

  - For inbound mail: use `createAddressBasedEmailResolver(agentName)`
  - For reply flows: use `createSecureReplyEmailResolver(secret)` with signed headers

  See https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/email.md for details.

  **`EmailSendOptions` type removed**: This type was unused and has been removed.

  #### New Features

  **`createSecureReplyEmailResolver`**: A new resolver that verifies HMAC-SHA256 signatures on incoming emails before routing. Signatures include a timestamp and expire after 30 days by default.

  ```ts
  const resolver = createSecureReplyEmailResolver(env.EMAIL_SECRET, {
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // Optional: 7 days (default: 30 days)
    onInvalidSignature: (email, reason) => {
      // Optional: log failures for debugging
      // reason: "missing_headers" | "expired" | "invalid" | "malformed_timestamp"
      console.warn(`Invalid signature from ${email.from}: ${reason}`);
    },
  });
  ```

  **`signAgentHeaders`**: Helper function to manually sign agent routing headers for use with external email services.

  ```ts
  const headers = await signAgentHeaders(secret, agentName, agentId);
  // Returns: { "X-Agent-Name", "X-Agent-ID", "X-Agent-Sig", "X-Agent-Sig-Ts" }
  ```

  **`replyToEmail` signing**: The `replyToEmail` method now accepts a `secret` option to automatically sign outbound email headers.

  ```ts
  await this.replyToEmail(email, {
    fromName: "My Agent",
    body: "Thanks!",
    secret: this.env.EMAIL_SECRET, // Signs headers for secure reply routing
  });
  ```

  If an email was routed via `createSecureReplyEmailResolver`, calling `replyToEmail` without a secret will throw an error (pass explicit `null` to opt-out).

  **`onNoRoute` callback**: `routeAgentEmail` now accepts an `onNoRoute` callback for handling emails that don't match any routing rule.

  ```ts
  await routeAgentEmail(message, env, {
    resolver,
    onNoRoute: (email) => {
      email.setReject("Unknown recipient");
    },
  });
  ```

  `setState()` is now synchronous instead of async. This improves ergonomics and aligns with the expected mental model for state updates.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### `setState()` returns `void` instead of `Promise<void>`

  ```typescript
  // Before (still works - awaiting a non-promise is harmless)
  await this.setState({ count: 1 });

  // After (preferred)
  this.setState({ count: 1 });
  ```

  Existing code that uses `await this.setState(...)` will continue to work without changes.

  ### `onStateUpdate()` no longer gates state broadcasts

  Previously, if `onStateUpdate()` threw an error, the state update would be aborted. Now, `onStateUpdate()` runs asynchronously via `ctx.waitUntil()` after the state is persisted and broadcast. Errors in `onStateUpdate()` are routed to `onError()` but do not prevent the state from being saved or broadcast.

  If you were using `onStateUpdate()` for validation, migrate to `validateStateChange()`.

  ## New Features

  ### `validateStateChange()` validation hook

  A new synchronous hook that runs before state is persisted or broadcast. Use this for validation:

  ```typescript
  validateStateChange(nextState: State, source: Connection | "server") {
    if (nextState.count < 0) {
      throw new Error("Count cannot be negative");
    }
  }
  ```

  - Runs synchronously before persistence and broadcast
  - Throwing aborts the state update entirely
  - Ideal for validation logic

  ### Execution order

  1. `validateStateChange(nextState, source)` - validation (sync, gating)
  2. State persisted to SQLite
  3. State broadcast to connected clients
  4. `onStateUpdate(nextState, source)` - notifications (async via `ctx.waitUntil`, non-gating)

  When using `scheduleSchema` with OpenAI models via the AI SDK, users must now pass `providerOptions: { openai: { strictJsonSchema: false } }` to `generateObject`. This is documented in the JSDoc for `scheduleSchema`.

  This is required because `@ai-sdk/openai` now defaults `strictJsonSchema` to `true`, which requires all schema properties to be in the `required` array. The `scheduleSchema` uses optional fields which are not compatible with this strict mode.

  Moved creation and deletion of the cf_agents_mcp_servers table from AgentMCPClientStorage to the Agent class. Removed redundant create and destroy methods from AgentMCPClientStorage and updated MCPClientManager to reflect these changes. Added comments to clarify usage in demo and test code.

- [#653](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/653) [`412321b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/412321bc9f8d58e3f8aa11a2aa6d646b7cb6c7ec) Thanks [@deathbyknowledge](https://github.com/deathbyknowledge)! - Allow `this.destroy` inside a schedule by including a `destroyed` flag and yielding `ctx.abort` instead of calling it directly
  Fix issue where schedules would not be able to run for more 30 seconds due to `blockConccurencyWhile`. `alarm()` isn't manually called anymore, getting rid of the bCW.
  Fix an issue where immediate schedules (e.g. `this.schedule(0, "foo"))`) would not get immediately scheduled.

  - **`MCPClientManager` API changes**:
    - New `registerServer()` method to register servers (replaces part of `connect()`)
    - New `connectToServer()` method to establish connection (replaces part of `connect()`)
    - `connect()` method deprecated (still works for backward compatibility)
  - **Connection state observability**: New `onServerStateChanged()` event for tracking all server state changes
  - **Improved reconnect logic**: `restoreConnectionsFromStorage()` handles failed connections

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed failed connections not being recreated on restore
  - Fixed redundant storage operations during connection restoration
  - Fixed potential OAuth storage initialization issue by excluding non-serializable authProvider from stored server options
  - Added defensive checks for storage initialization in MCPClientManager and DurableObjectOAuthClientProvider
  - Fixed initialization order: MCPClientManager is now created AFTER database tables are created to prevent possible table-not-found errors during DO restart

- [#672](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/672) [`7c9f8b0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/7c9f8b0aed916701bcd97faa2747ee288bdb40d6) Thanks [@mattzcarey](https://github.com/mattzcarey)! - - `MCPClientConnection.init()` no longer triggers discovery automatically. Discovery should be done via `discover()` or through `MCPClientManager.discoverIfConnected()`

  ### Features

  - New `discover()` method on `MCPClientConnection` with full lifecycle management:
    - Handles state transitions (CONNECTED → DISCOVERING → READY on success, CONNECTED on failure)
    - Supports cancellation via AbortController (cancels previous in-flight discovery)
    - Configurable timeout (default 15s)
  - New `cancelDiscovery()` method to abort in-flight discoveries
  - New `discoverIfConnected()` on `MCPClientManager` for simpler capability discovery per server
  - `createConnection()` now returns the connection object for immediate use
  - Created `MCPConnectionState` enum to formalize possible states: `idle`, `connecting`, `authenticating`, `connected`, `discovering`, `ready`, `failed`

  ### Fixes

  - **Fixed discovery hanging on repeated requests** - New discoveries now cancel previous in-flight ones via AbortController
  - **Fixed Durable Object crash-looping** - `restoreConnectionsFromStorage()` now starts connections in background (fire-and-forget) to avoid blocking `onStart` and causing `blockConcurrencyWhile` timeouts
  - **Fixed OAuth callback race condition** - When `auth_url` exists in storage during restoration, state is set to AUTHENTICATING directly instead of calling `connectToServer()` which was overwriting the state
  - **Set discovery timeout to 15s**
  - MCP Client Discovery failures now throw errors immediately instead of continuing with empty arrays
  - Added "connected" state to represent a connected server with no tools loaded yet

  The SSE transport now properly forwards session IDs and request headers to MCP message handlers, achieving closer header parity with StreamableHTTP transport. This allows MCP servers using SSE to access request headers for session management.

This feature enables:

  - Remote procedure calls from clients to agents
  - Method decoration with `@unstable_callable` to expose agent methods
  - Support for both regular and streaming RPC calls
  - Type-safe RPC calls with automatic response handling
  - Real-time streaming responses for long-running operations

  Note: The `callable` decorator has been renamed to `unstable_callable` to indicate its experimental status.

  This clears the initial messages cache whenever useAgentChat is unmounted. Additionally, it adds a getInitialMessages option to pass your own custom method for setting initial messages. Setting getInitialMessages:null disables any fetch for initial messages, so that the user can populate initialMessages by themselves if they'd like.

  I also added a chat example to the playground.

  You can now set an initial state for an agent

  ```ts
  type State = {
    counter: number;
    text: string;
    color: string;
  };

  class MyAgent extends Agent<Env, State> {
    initialState = {
      counter: 0,
      text: "",
      color: "#3B82F6",
    };

    doSomething() {
      console.log(this.state); // {counter: 0, text: "", color: "#3B82F6"}, if you haven't set the state yet
    }
  }
  ```

  As before, this gets synced to useAgent, so you can do:

  ```ts
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>();
  const agent = useAgent<State>({
    agent: "my-agent",
    onStateUpdate: (state) => {
      setState(state);
    },
  });
  ```
